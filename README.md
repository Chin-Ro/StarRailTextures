# StarRailTextures
## All extracted textures from honkai star rail, provided by [Escartem](https://github.com/Escartem)

Some notes :
* textures are extremly messy, I started working on a mapping, you can find the already sorted ones in `assets/asbres`, the others one are also sorted but not based of the game files paths
* Numbers map characters and not their names directly, you can find the reference table here
